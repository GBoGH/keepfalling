# Keep Faling
My first game made with Python 3 and Pygame  
You are welcome to suggest changes and improvements

### Running the game
All you need to do in order to play the game is: clone or download the repository, do ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` and start game.py

### Databse
I realize that database credentials are included in the code, despite the fact they should not be. It is a random free database, used only for this purpose. Not the most ideal solution but most efficient in this case.  
Please do not misbehave. Like why would you even wanna do something with it?
